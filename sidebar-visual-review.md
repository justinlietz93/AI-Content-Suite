# Sidebar Organizer Visual Review Sign-off

## Overview
- **Date:** 2025-09-24
- **Reviewer:** UI implementation team
- **Scope:** Validate collapsed and expanded sidebar organizer visuals against design tokens and interaction requirements prior to product/design approval.

## Collapsed Mode Assessment
- Verified icon-only presentation by rendering the collapsed sidebar and ensuring no visible text labels surface while category handles remain accessible. Automated parity spec `tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/parity.test.tsx` confirms the icon-only requirement by asserting hidden label geometry and drag ordering semantics. 
- Inspected `components/layouts/sidebarOrganizer/CollapsedCategoryHandle.tsx` to ensure the collapsed handle applies the tokenized background (`bg-secondary/70`), text (`text-text-secondary`), and ring styling (`focus-visible:ring-ring`). Hover and drop state classes (`bg-primary/20`, `ring-primary/60`) preserve contrast for product review.
- Confirmed drop indicator span uses the thicker `h-1` token, offset rings, and ambient-suppression styling to align with design guidance for tight icon clusters.

## Expanded Mode Assessment
- Reviewed `components/layouts/sidebarOrganizer/CategoryHeader.tsx` to validate the header retains uppercase typography, neutral text tokens, and ring-based drag affordances (`ring-primary/70`).
- Checked that the action tray remains hidden until pointer or keyboard focus enters the leading edge, matching the intended minimal chrome aesthetic.
- Exercised parity spec cases to confirm expanded feature rows respect reordering requirements and maintain consistent layout spacing across categories.

## Drop Indicators and Cross-mode Consistency
- Drag interaction suite `tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/dragInteractions.test.tsx` verifies high-contrast drop guides (`bg-primary`, `ring-offset-surface`) and collapsed handle highlight states during feature hover, providing objective evidence for design sign-off.
- Stress regression within the same suite executes 20 cross-category drags without introducing console noise, ensuring no visual flicker or error overlays appear during prolonged sessions.

## Accessibility and Interaction Notes
- Parity suite confirms collapsed handles expose accessible drag toggles without revealing textual labels, while `CategorySection` wiring keeps feature drop zones available even when sections collapse.
- Keyboard and pointer focus tokens remain ring-based, aligning with accessibility sign-off criteria and ensuring consistent focus visuals across modes.

## Product/Design Sign-off Decision
All reviewed elements comply with the specified design tokens, interaction patterns, and accessibility criteria for both collapsed and expanded presentations. The implementation is ready for product and design sign-off pending any final stakeholder feedback.
