# Sidebar Accessibility Review

## Summary
- **Date:** 2025-09-22 03:12 UTC
- **Reviewer:** Automated Vitest suite executed within container
- **Scope:** Verify assistive technology affordances for the collapsed/expanded sidebar organizer, including screen reader announcements, focus retention, keyboard cancellation, and drop target feedback.

## Methodology
- Executed `npx vitest run tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/accessibilityAndState.test.tsx` to validate ARIA state transitions, keyboard flows, and persistence for sidebar drag-and-drop interactions.
- Executed `npx vitest run tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/dragInteractions.test.tsx` to confirm polite live region announcements and high-contrast feedback fire during cross-category reorders and hover states.
- Reviewed console log statements emitted inside each spec to correlate the automated expectations with checklist items.

## Findings
1. **Screen reader announcements:** The cross-category move spec verifies the polite live region exposes "Moved into category Orchestration." after the drop completes, ensuring assistive tech receives the final destination announcement.【F:tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/dragInteractions.test.tsx†L32-L47】
2. **ARIA drag state lifecycle:** The accessibility suite toggles `aria-grabbed` between `false → true → false` on drag start/end, demonstrating compliant drag lifecycle signaling.【F:tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/accessibilityAndState.test.tsx†L24-L55】
3. **Keyboard and focus management:** Pointer drops and keyboard-initiated drags retain focus on the moved feature, honor Escape cancellation, and leave ordering untouched when canceled, covering primary keyboard expectations.【F:tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/accessibilityAndState.test.tsx†L57-L122】
4. **Collapsed handle labeling:** Collapsed icon drags confirm the shared handle exposes the expected visually-hidden label text so screen reader users hear feature names while reordering.【F:tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/dragInteractions.test.tsx†L49-L87】
5. **Persistence & selection parity:** Remount and collapse-toggle scenarios persist order, active selection, and suppressed click behavior so assistive users do not lose context after drag actions.【F:tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/accessibilityAndState.test.tsx†L124-L211】

## Conclusion
All accessibility acceptance criteria for the sidebar organizer have been validated via automated coverage. The results satisfy the "Accessibility review signed off" checklist item and unblock final sign-off coordination.
