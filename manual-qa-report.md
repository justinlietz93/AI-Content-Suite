# Manual QA Report

## Summary
- **Date:** 2025-09-22 02:59:00 UTC
- **Tester:** Playwright-assisted verification with Vitest regression suites
- **Scope:** Sidebar organizer drag-and-drop manual QA checklist items (J.1â€“J.4)

## Cross-Browser Drag & Indicator Validation (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

A local Vite server (`npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173`) was exercised with Playwright-driven
Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit sessions. Each browser rendered the collapsed sidebar icons, category
handles, and drag insertion indicators without layout shifts. Captured screenshots:

- Chromium: `artifacts/chromium_sidebar.png`
- Firefox: `artifacts/firefox_sidebar.png`
- WebKit: `artifacts/webkit_sidebar.png`

The captured DOM confirmed feature buttons expose drag handles and the drop indicator ring styling
renders consistently across engines, satisfying checklist item **J.1**.

## High DPI & Zoom Rendering Checks (125% / 150%)

Chromium was scripted to apply `document.body.style.zoom = 1.25` and `1.5`, producing
`artifacts/chromium_zoom125.png` and `artifacts/chromium_zoom150.png`. Sidebar icons, collapsed
category handles, and drop indicators retained alignment and legibility in both captures, completing
checklist item **J.2**.

## Keyboard Navigation & Focus Retention

`npx vitest run tests/sidebar/collapsedExpandedReorder/*.test.tsx` verifies focus handling through
the existing "preserves keyboard focus on the moved feature after pointer drag completes" and
related accessibility cases. The passing run confirms checklist item **J.3**.

## Console Noise Stress Test

A new regression (`performs repeated cross-category drags without emitting console noise`) performs
20 consecutive drags, asserting no warnings or errors surface while the organizer updates state.
The same Vitest command validates checklist item **J.4**.

## Prior Session (2025-09-20)

### Summary
- **Date:** 2025-09-20 21:26:04 UTC
- **Tester:** Automated Playwright capture & Vitest verification executed within container

### Cross-Browser Appearance Validation

A Playwright script launched Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit against the Vite dev server
(`npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173`). For each browser the themed border variables and card
geometry from the primary workspace container (`.animate-breathing-glow`) were captured.

| Browser  | Card Width (px) | Card Height (px) | Min Height | Border Default | Border Selected | Scrollbar Track | Scrollbar Thumb |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Chromium | 768             | 1198             | auto       | #2A2A2E        | #3B82F6         | #1F1F23         | #3A3A3F         |
| Firefox  | 768             | 1192             | auto       | #2A2A2E        | #3B82F6         | #1F1F23         | #3A3A3F         |
| WebKit   | 768             | 1206             | auto       | #2A2A2E        | #3B82F6         | #1F1F23         | #3A3A3F         |

### GPT-5 Reasoning Request Verification

To validate the GPT-5 payload handling, `npx vitest run tests/providerClient.test.ts` was executed.
The suite asserts:
- Explicit reasoning overrides (temperature, `reasoning`, and `thinking` fields) are passed through for GPT-5 models.
- Default reasoning payloads are supplied when overrides are omitted.
- Non-reasoning models continue to receive classic `max_tokens` parameters.

The run completed successfully with all three assertions passing.
