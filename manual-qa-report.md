# Manual QA Report

## Summary
- **Date:** 2025-09-20 21:26:04 UTC
- **Tester:** Automated Playwright capture & Vitest verification executed within container

## Cross-Browser Appearance Validation

A Playwright script launched Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit against the Vite dev server (`npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173`).
For each browser we captured the themed border variables and card geometry from the primary workspace container (`.animate-breathing-glow`).

| Browser  | Card Width (px) | Card Height (px) | Min Height | Border Default | Border Selected | Scrollbar Track | Scrollbar Thumb |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Chromium | 768             | 1198             | auto       | #2A2A2E        | #3B82F6         | #1F1F23         | #3A3A3F         |
| Firefox  | 768             | 1192             | auto       | #2A2A2E        | #3B82F6         | #1F1F23         | #3A3A3F         |
| WebKit   | 768             | 1206             | auto       | #2A2A2E        | #3B82F6         | #1F1F23         | #3A3A3F         |

The results confirm consistent layout sizing and dark theme tokens across the tested engines. A Chromium snapshot was also stored at `artifacts/chromium-workspace.png` for reference.

## GPT-5 Reasoning Request Verification

To validate the GPT-5 payload handling, `npx vitest run tests/providerClient.test.ts` was executed. The suite asserts:
- Explicit reasoning overrides (temperature, `reasoning`, and `thinking` fields) are passed through for GPT-5 models.
- Default reasoning payloads are supplied when overrides are omitted.
- Non-reasoning models continue to receive classic `max_tokens` parameters.

The run completed successfully with all three assertions passing.
